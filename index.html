      <h2>Research Summary</h2>
      <p>
In my research, I explore the dual reality of startups as engines of innovation and growth, yet often constrained by limited resources and uncertain futures. My dissertation takes this dual reality seriously, by engaging with the challenges startups face as employers, as well as the barriers that entrepreneurs and early-stage employees encounter when transitioning into traditional paid employment.
      </p>
      <p>
A distinctive feature of my dissertation is its use of proprietary data that I independently acquired from an online job platform in South Korea, a key player in the countryâ€™s startup labor market. I also use large-scale labor data from Revelio Labs and online experiments to uncover how entrepreneurship is evaluated and how to improve outcomes for both startups and workers.
