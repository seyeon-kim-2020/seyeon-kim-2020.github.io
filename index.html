      <h2>Research Summary</h2>
      <p>
        My research explores the intersection of entrepreneurship and labor markets, focusing on startups’ dual role as engines of economic growth and as employers facing unique challenges. While startups generate significant jobs and innovations, they also encounter disadvantages such as limited resources and uncertain futures. My dissertation investigates these challenges faced by startups as employers, as well as the barriers entrepreneurs and early-stage employees experience when transitioning into traditional employment.

        A key contribution of my work is the use of proprietary data from a South Korean online job platform that captures full hiring pipelines—from applications to outcomes—enabling a detailed study of supply- and demand-side hiring dynamics. Additionally, I leverage large-scale digital trace data and design interactive experiments simulating hiring decisions to better understand how entrepreneurship shapes career trajectories and hiring evaluations. Ultimately, my research aims to provide insights to improve hiring outcomes for startups and workers alike.
