    <h2>Job Market Paper</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div class="paper-title">Seyeon Kim. “Sorting into Startups: Unpacking Supply‑ and Demand‑Side Dynamics in Hiring.”</div>
        <div class="paper-status">In Preparation for Submission</div>
        Using a proprietary dataset of 7 million job applications and interview records from a Korean digital hiring platform (2015‑2024), my job‑market paper disentangles how applicant and employer behaviors jointly shape who works for startups. I find that both highly and lower-credentialed candidates gravitate toward startups—but to different types and through distinct mechanisms. I introduce a 2×2 framework of preference- vs. constraint-driven behavior and show that highly credentialed candidates match with prestige-signaling young firms through mutual selection, while lower-credentialed candidates are hired by small startups that still prefer higher-credentialed applicants but cast a wide net out. The study presents novel insights into applicant and employer behavior, sorting mechanisms across the hiring funnel, and heterogeneity among startups. Doing so reconciles competing portrayals of startup hiring and highlights how symbolic quality signals shape talent flows into early-stage firms.

        <div class="paper-status">In Preparation for Submission</div>
        I use text network analysis to investigate how employers interpret entrepreneurial experience versus conventional employment. While prior research tends to assume uniformly negative beliefs about former founders, I collect and analyze open-ended employer evaluations of simulated resumes to uncover how such beliefs are structured. Using topic co-occurrence networks and community detection, I find that beliefs about employees tend to cluster cleanly—positive traits like leadership, competence, and stability co-occur, while negative ones remain separate. In contrast, founder resumes evoke more cognitively complex and ambivalent evaluations. Founder resumes activate similar positive traits such as initiative, but these often co-occur with concerns about self-orientation or defiance of authority. These findings suggest that founder experience invites more interpretive ambiguity than prior research has captured, and that the meaning of the same signal may shift depending on the evaluative context.
